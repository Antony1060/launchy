/// ## Double buffering
/// To make more economical use of data, the Launchpad has a feature called double buffering.
/// Essentially, Launchpad manages two sets of LED data - buffers - for each pad. By default, these
/// are configured so that the buffer that is updated by incoming MIDI messages is the same as the
/// one that is visible, so that note-on messages immediately change their respective pads. However,
/// the buffers can also be configured so that Launchpadâ€™s LED status is updated invisibly. With a
/// single command, these buffers can then be swapped. The pads will instantly update to show their
/// pre-programmed state, while the pads can again be updated invisibly ready for the next swap. The
/// visible buffer can alternatively be configured to swap automatically at 280ms intervals in order
/// to configure LEDs to flash.
