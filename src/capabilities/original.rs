	/// Launchpad controls the brightness of its LEDs by continually switching them on and off

	/// of altering the proportion of time for which the LEDs are on while they are in low- and
	/// medium-brightness modes. This proportion is known as the duty cycle.
	/// Manipulating this is useful for fade effects, for adjusting contrast, and for creating
	/// custom palettes.
	/// The default duty cycle is 1/5 meaning that low-brightness LEDs are on for only every fifth
	/// multiplex pass, and medium-brightness LEDs are on for two passes in every five.
	/// Generally, lower duty cycles (numbers closer to zero) will increase contrast between
	/// different brightness settings but will also increase flicker; higher ones will eliminate
	/// flicker, but will also reduce contrast. Note that using less simple ratios (such as 3/17 or
	/// 2/11) can also increase	perceived flicker.
	/// If you are particularly sensitive to strobing lights, please use this command with care when
	/// working with large areas of low-brightness LEDs: in particular, avoid duty cycles of 1/8 or
	/// less.
